# Docker

- Docker is an OS-level virtualization or containerization platform, which allows application to share the host OS kernel instead of running a separate guest OS like traditional virtualization.
- This is a way of packaging a software so that it can run on any hardware
  
  > Docker solves the problem of "It works on my machine" by ensuring code runs identically across environments

## 1. Docker Engine

- Docker engine is an open source technology that includes a seerver running a background process called a REST API and a command-line interface (CLI) known as 'docker'.
- The Docker Engine is the actual technology behind building, shipping, and running container applications.
- It does its work in a client-server model, which requires using many components and services for such operations.
- It's main components are : Docker daemon, Docker Client, REST API

### Docker Engine Architecture

- *Docker Daemon* - Also called 'dockerd' is essential. It manages and runs docker containers and handles their creation. It acts as a server in Docker's setup, receiving requests and commands from other components.
- *Docker client* - Users communicate with Docker through the CLI client (docker). This client talks to the Docker daemon using Docker APIs, allowing for direct command-line interaction or scripting. This flexibility enables diverse operational approaches.
- *Docker images and containers* - Images act as unchanging blueprints. Containers are created from these blueprints. Containers provideÂ­ the surroundings needed to run apps.
- *Docker registries* - These are places where Docker images live and get shared.
- *Networking and volumes* - Docker has networking capabilities. They control how containers talk to one another and the host system. Volumes in Docker allow data storage across containers. This enhances data handling within Docker.
